#Q-5  

As AdventureWorks continues to grow more and more data will be captured, meaning proper storage and server space will be needed. Dan Wilson, the database administrator at AdventureWorks has reached out to you. Dan is currently working on a project to determine how much storage and server space will be needed for the next year. He has asked you to idenitfy the following 5 columns:

a.  Table Name

b. The number of rows in each user table (remember there are 71 user tables. 72 if you count sysdiagrams for the entity relationship diagram.) Use the rows column in sys.partitions.

c. The current allocated space for each table in kilobytes (kb)

d. The used space for each table in kilobytes (kb)

e. The unused space for each table in kilobytes (kb)


*Note* (pages * 8) = kilobytes

#Q-6 AdventureWorks is implementing a third party software to track customer and product information. Each person in the database will be assigned a default username and password.

a. Create a username for each person by removing the "@adventure-works.com" on their email in the EmailAddress table. For example, the CEO, Ken Sanchez's username will be "Ken0"

b. Are there any duplicate usernames?

c. Take the results from Part A and join Person.Person. Then create a temporary password by concatenating the elements below:

1. First 2 characters of First Name

3. Last 2 characters of Last Name

4. "."

5. First 5 characters of NewID()

c. Declare a second local variable called @CurrentYear. Insert the most recent orderdate year into @CurrentYear.    Data type int.

d. Use @TopSalesPersonID and @currentYear in a where clause and show top 10 products (SubTotal) that this person has sold in the current year.

# Q- 8 You've been asked to create a stored procedure that can be used for an online interface. This interface will allow customers to search for their Purchase History at AdventureWorks. When the customer inputs their phone number and account number into the online interface their will be able to see the products they purchased, the date it was ordered/purchased on, and the line total for each product.

a. Write a statement that includes the following elements:

- Person FullName (First and Last Name)

- Account Number

- Phone Number

- Order Date (SalesOrderHeader)

- Product Name

- Line Total



b. Put this statement into a stored procedure. Add two parameters to    the stored procedure - Account Number and Phone Number. These parameters will require input variables in order to return the correct information.



c. Exec the Stored Procedure for the following Account Numbers and Phone numbers.

- Phone Number: 245-555-0173 Account Number '10-4020-000001'

- Phone Number: 417-555-0131 Account Number '10-4030-021762'

- Phone Number 620-555-0117 Account Number '10-4020-000695'

# Q-9 You will notice that the Sales.SalesOrderDetail table has three indexes:

AK_SalesOrderDetail_rowguid

IX_SalesOrderDetail_ProductID

PK_SalesOrderDetail_SalesOrderID_SalesOrderDetailID



a. Drop the first index -  AK_SalesOrderDetail_rowguid



b. Drop the second index - IX_SalesOrderDetail_ProductID


# Q- 10 Batching using a while loop is an effective way to improve performance when working with large datasets. Although in this question we will not be working with a large dataset we will be creating a while loop. We are going to create a table with two columns - SalesOrderHeader.Orderdate and TotalDue... In other words this will give you Daily Gross Revenue. We are going to insert this data into a table in increments of 100. Below you will see a Create Table and Insert Into Statement:

Create Table Sales.DailyRevenue
    (OrderDate Date
    ,TotalDue money)
Insert Into Sales.DailyRevenue
    (OrderDate
    ,TotalDue)
Select 
    OrderDate
    ,Sum(Totaldue) as TotalDue
From Sales.SalesOrderHeader
Group by OrderDate
Order by 1 desc


a. This insert statement is inserting 1,124 rows of data into Sales.DailyRevenue. Put this statement into a while loop and only insert 100 rows at a time.



b. Print a message in the while loop that will give an update on what OrderDates were inserted into the table. For Example, "Data Between May 2011 through September 2011 inserted"
