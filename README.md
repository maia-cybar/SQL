# AdventureWorks Sample Database Project

Hello, and thanks for stopping by! Welcome to my personal SQL This repository contains examples of SQL I've written for solo projects and while working through SQL and data analytics.
Here you'll find a collection of SQL projects and queries I've worked on, showcasing my skills and expertise in database management, data analysis, and data manipulation using SQL.
The AdventureWorks databases are sample databases that were originally published by Microsoft to show how to design a SQL Server database using SQL Server 2008.

## AdventureWorks is the OLTP sample, and AdventureWorksDW is the data warehouse sample.
â€¢	This project uses the AdventureWorks sample database to showcase various SQL queries, data analysis, and reports.
